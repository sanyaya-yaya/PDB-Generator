# PDB Generator

## Overview

This Python script, `bt305.py`, generates multiple RIB files containing random sequences of amino acid residues, along with their phi and psi angles. Each RIB file generated by this script can be utilized to produce its corresponding PDB file using Ribosome or other molecular modeling tools.

## Usage

1. **Requirements**:
   - Python 3 installed on your system.

2. **Execution**:
   - Run the `bt305.py` script.
   - You will be prompted to enter the number of RIB files to create and the total number of residues.
     ```bash
     python bt305.py
     ```

3. **Output**:
   - The generated RIB files will be stored in the `ribfiles` directory.

## Parameters

- **Number of RIB files**: Specifies the number of RIB files to generate.
- **Number of Residues**: Specifies the total number of residues for each RIB file.

## Generating PDB Files

To generate PDB files from the generated RIB files, you can utilize Ribosome or other molecular modeling software. Follow these steps:

1. **Install Ribosome**:
   - Download and install Ribosome

2. **Convert RIB to PDB**:
   - Use Ribosome's command-line interface to convert RIB files to PDB files.
   - Navigate to the directory containing the generated RIB files.
   - Run the following command to convert a single RIB file to PDB:
     ```bash
     ribosome input.rib -out output.pdb
     ```

   - Replace `input.rib` with the name of your RIB file and `output.pdb` with the desired name for the PDB file.

3. **Batch Conversion**:
   - To convert multiple RIB files to PDB files in batch, use a loop or scripting to automate the process.
